# Growth
The code and final build for a 2D puzzle side-scroller prototype created with Unity in 9 days.  
  
Growth is a puzzle game where you play as GB, an old handheld system repurposed as a flower pot, who helps CRT, a robot with a TV for a head, to find and preserve the small amount of plantlife left in the world. The two charcters help eachother through a series of puzzles that make use of GB's unique reach mechanic. 
  
A/D or <-/-> to move, and Spacebar or W to extend GB's flower.  
  
The final build of the game is in the Game folder, while the code is in the code folder.
